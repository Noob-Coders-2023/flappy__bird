# Python Game Development-Flappy bird

Flappy Bird is a classic and addictive game that has captured the hearts of millions with its simple yet challenging gameplay. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of building your very own Flappy Bird game from scratch, using the Pygame module, a popular Python library for game development.

With just a basic understanding of Python and a dash of creativity, you can harness Pygame's capabilities to create a fun and engaging gaming experience that can be customized to your liking.

## Game Setup
Let's start by making sure Pygame is installed on your computer. Open your terminal and install the pygame module using pip:


$ pip install pygame


After that, create a directory for the game and create the following .py files inside it: settings.py, main.py, world.py, game.py, pipe.py, bird.py. Also, create another folder inside the game directory and name it assets, which we'll use to store game media files.

Now we can start coding. Let's define our game variables and functions in settings.py
Next, let's create the main class of our game in main.py which also contains the game's main loop
